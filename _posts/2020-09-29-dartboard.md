Inspired by this [post on visualizing
uncertainty](https://magazine.northwestern.edu/exclusives/understanding-uncertainty/),
I present the 538 election forecast for 2020 as a dartboard.

Currently 538 gives Biden a 78 in 100 chance of winning the electoral
college (and Trump a 22 in 100 chance). To represent the uncertainty in
that outcome, imagine throwing a dart at any of the dartboards below.
How many times would you hit blue vs red?

The amount of confidence you have the dart would hit a blue square
represents the confidence you should have in a Biden victory.
