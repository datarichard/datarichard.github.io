2. Creating a new Rproj using File > New Project...
3. Select the option for `Version Control: Checkout a project from a version control repository`.  
3. Follow the instructions to integrate the project with the github repo created in step 1.  

## Step 2. Enable pages for the new repo.

2. Place the html version of the paper into the new docs folder, using `index.html` as the filename
3. Go to settings and enable Github Pages, using the `main` branch.
4. Select the docs/ folder as the publishing source.
