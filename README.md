## Step 1. Install Anaconda. 
See [here](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/macos.html) for instructions and download package.  
```
bash ~/Downloads/Anaconda3-2018.12-MacOSX-x86_64
```

However if you just want miniconda, download the package and:
```
bash ~/Downloads/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
```
